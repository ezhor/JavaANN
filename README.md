# JavaANN
A strongly object oriented implementation of a neural network in Java.

This implementation is my own point of view of how the object hierarchy should be designed.
Probably this is not a good implementation in matters of design and/or performance.

The objective of this project is to research and experiment with neural networks.
I'm working on a [C++ implementation](https://github.com/ezhor/C-Plus-Plus-ANN) with many improvements (especially in matters of performance)
